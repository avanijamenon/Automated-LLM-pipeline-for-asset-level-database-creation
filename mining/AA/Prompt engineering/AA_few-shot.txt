----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chunk 17:
Here's a breakdown of the physical assets, locations, ownerships, and commodities mentioned in the text, along with their relationships:

**physical assets:**  [Aluminum smelters, mines (bauxite, alumina), warehouses] - While not explicitly named, these are implied through descriptions of production processes and market dynamics. 

**locations:** [Globally dispersed markets (Midwest US, LME regions), emerging economies (India, Brazil, Southeast Asian countries), China]

**ownerships:**  [The text does not clearly specify ownership of physical assets or companies. It mentions "industry producers," "other industry producers," and "our" implying potential ownership by the company being described.]

**commodities:** [Aluminum, alumina, bauxite, copper (implied)]


**relationships:** 
Due to the lack of specific asset names and ownerships in the text, providing concrete relationships is difficult. Here are some general connections implied:

* **Aluminum smelters**  likely located in various regions globally, process **aluminum** from sources like mines (potentially **bauxite**) and alumina refineries. 
* **Mines (bauxite)** and **alumina refineries** are likely geographically dispersed based on the mention of regional premiums for aluminum delivery.
* **Warehouses** (implied by LME inventory discussions) store **aluminum**, potentially including Russian-origin stocks, which can influence LME pricing.

* **Emerging economies** like India, Brazil, and Southeast Asian countries are mentioned as potential sources of increased demand for **aluminum**.

Chunk 29:
Here's a breakdown of the physical assets, locations, ownerships, and commodities mentioned in the text you provided, along with their relationships.

**physical assets:**  [Company facilities, Information technology infrastructure]

**locations:** [ ] 

**ownerships:** [Alcoa Corporation, The Company (referring to Alcoa Corporation)]
